      "In the previous section, we discussed designing FIR filters using the windowing method. One shortcoming of the windowing method is that it doesn't provide  clear specification of the passband to stopband transition, or other filter characteristics important for practical design. In this section, we discuss the Parks-McClellan algorithm for designing FIR filters with a comparatively richer filter specification that usually results in smaller filter orders for same frequency response. Unfortunately, the algorithm itself is based on certain advanced theorems so we will just use it to get acceptable filter coefficients."

      "The Parks-McClellan algorithm generates filter coefficients by solving the *optimum equiripple Chebyshev approximation* to the ideal filter provided in the specification.  The Parks-McClellan algorithm internally uses the Remez exchange technique so the corresponding function in the `signal` module is called `signal.remez`. The function takes the `numtaps` argument which is $M$ in our rotation, the `bands` argument is a sequence of passband/stopband edges in normalized frequency (i.e. provided by $f_s/2$), the `desired` argument is a `numpy` array (or other array-like iterable ) that is half the length of the `bands` argument and contains the desired gain in each of the specified bands. The next argument is the optional `weight` which is array-like, half the length of the `bands` argument, and provides the relative weighting for the passband/stopband. The unfortunately named optional `Hz` argument (default=1) is the sampling frequency in the same units as the `bands`. The next optional argument is the type of filter response in each of the bands (i.e. bandpass, hilbert). The default is `bandpass` filter. The remaining arguments of the function call have to do with the internal operation of the iterative algorithm.\n",

Note that drop from the passband to the sidelobes steepens with increasing $ M $. As we have seen before with window functions, this is because the window's mainlobe narrows with increasing sequence length. Naturally, you can use other Windows besides Hamming and change the sidelobe level and mainlobe width. The most popular window used for this method of filter design is the Kaiser-Bessel window because it provides extra parameters for tuning the frequency response."

Ultimately, we want a richer characterization of the desired frequency response. Our next section covers the Remez method that provides these parameters."
